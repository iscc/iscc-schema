    description: Description of the *digital content* identified by the **ISCC** (used as
      input for Meta-Code generation). Any user presentable text string (including Markdown
      text) indicative of the identity  of the referent may be used.
    x-iscc-context: http://schema.org/disambiguatingDescription
    x-iscc-schema-doc: A sub property of description. A short description of the item used
      to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular,
      name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.

    description: Descriptive, industry-sector or use-case specific metadata. Can be any object
      that is JSON/JCS serializable. If `metadata` is provided it is used as an input for
      Meta-Code generation and as the sole input for the cryptographic `metahash` calculation.
      If `metadata` is set to a string it is assumed that it is base64 encoded binary file
      metadata.

    description: URI for a user-presentable image that serves as a preview of the *digital
      content*. The URI may be a Data-URL [RFC2397](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2397).
      If **ISCC** metadata is used as NFT metadata according to [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/)
      or [ERC-1155](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/) the
      URI should reference the actual digital content represented by the NFT.

    x-iscc-context: http://schema.org/image
    x-iscc-schema-doc: An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject.
