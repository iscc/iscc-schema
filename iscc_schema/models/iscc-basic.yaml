    x-iscc-schema-doc: A sub property of description. A short description of the item used
      to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular,
      name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.

    minProperties: 1
    description: Descriptive, industry-sector or use-case specific metadata. **Used as input
      for ISCC Meta-Code generation**. Can be any object that is JSON/JCS serializable. If
      `metadata` is provided it is used as an input for Meta-Code generation and as the sole
      input for the cryptographic `metahash` calculation. If `metadata` is set to a string
      it is assumed that it is base64 encoded binary file metadata.
